# Terminal Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A lightweight Python program that demonstrates and compares the speed of different sorting algorithms directly in your terminal.

---

## Overview
This tool provides a simple, visual way to observe how sorting algorithms perform on random data arrays of varying sizes and speeds.

Tip: For very large arrays (n ≥ 10,000), use CTRL - to zoom out and better fit the visualization in your terminal.

---

## How to Use

Run with make to build and execute the program:
```bash
$ make          # or 'make re' to rebuild, 'make clean' to clean up
$ ./sort_script
```

---

## Choose Your Algorithm

You’ll be prompted to select a sorting method:
```bash
(1): Bubble sort
(2): Selection sort
```

---

## Choose Visualization Speed

Then pick how fast you want the visualization to run:
```bash
(1): Default
(2): Slow
(3): Very slow
```

---

## Example

Here’s a quick look at the visualizer in action:

## TODO
- Add more algorithms
- Display real-time stats and more stats overall
